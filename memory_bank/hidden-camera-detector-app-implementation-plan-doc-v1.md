## 1. Project Setup

### Step 1.1 ‚Äî Initialize Flutter Environment
- Install latest **Flutter stable 3.x.x** and **Dart 3.x.x**.
- Create new project:
  ```bash
  flutter create hidden_camera_detector
  ```
- Add linting:
  ```bash
  flutter pub add --dev very_good_analysis
  ```
- Enable strict analysis in `analysis_options.yaml`.

‚úÖ **Test:** Run `flutter analyze` ‚Äî ensure no lint issues.

---

### Step 1.2 ‚Äî Setup Folder Structure
- Under `lib/src/`, create:
  ```
  presentation/
  domain/
  data/
  ```
- Add `lib/core/` and `lib/main.dart`.
- Verify imports follow clean architecture layers.

‚úÖ **Test:** Run `flutter analyze` and confirm no circular dependencies.

---

### Step 1.3 ‚Äî Configure Build Flavors
- Define **development**, **staging**, **production** in Xcode.
- Use `--dart-define-from-file` for API/environment variables.

‚úÖ **Test:** Build and run each flavor successfully in simulator.

---

### Step 1.4 ‚Äî Configure Assets & Branding
- Add and run:
  ```bash
  flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
  flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
  ```
‚úÖ **Test:** Launch app ‚Äî verify correct app icon and splash screen.

---

## 2. Presentation Layer (UI)

### Step 2.1 ‚Äî Setup Navigation
- Add `go_router`.
- Define routes:
  ```
  /onboarding
  /dashboard
  /scan/wifi
  /scan/bluetooth
  /scan/ir
  /results
  /settings
  /paywall
  ```
- Implement route guards for premium routes via subscription status provider.

‚úÖ **Test:**  
- Navigation between routes works.  
- Premium-only routes redirect to `/paywall` when unsubscribed.

---

### Step 2.2 ‚Äî Onboarding Flow
- Create `OnboardingScreen` with:
  - Welcome animation + ‚ÄúScan‚Äù button.
  - Requests Bluetooth + Local Network permissions.
  - Save onboarding completion flag via `shared_preferences`.

‚úÖ **Test:** Launch fresh ‚Üí onboarding visible. Relaunch ‚Üí skipped.

---

### Step 2.3 ‚Äî Core UI Components
Under `presentation/widgets/`, create:
- `ScanButton(type: ScanType)`
- `DeviceResultCard(device: DetectedDevice)`
- `ProximityIndicator()`

‚úÖ **Test:** Render each widget in isolation and verify with Golden tests.

---

### Step 2.4 ‚Äî Theme System
- Define centralized `ThemeData` and custom color/text extensions.
- Apply globally.

‚úÖ **Test:** Toggle light/dark mode ‚Äî verify consistent theming.

---

### Step 2.5 ‚Äî Dashboard
- Three tabs:
  - **Wi-Fi Scan**
  - **Infrared (Camera)**
  - **Bluetooth (Premium)**
- Implement freemium restriction on Wi-Fi tab (show only 1 device).

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Free user ‚Üí limited device view.  
Premium user ‚Üí full list + Bluetooth enabled.

---

### Step 2.6 ‚Äî Paywall Screen
- Display blurred scan results.
- Show RevenueCat offerings (weekly/yearly).
- Include ‚ÄúContinue without subscribing‚Äù option.

‚úÖ **Test:** Offerings load and purchase triggers correct RevenueCat flow.

---

### Step 2.7 ‚Äî Settings Screen
- Add:
  - Restore Purchases
  - Clear All Data
  - Privacy Policy link
  - App version

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Restore reinstates premium entitlement.  
Data clear resets onboarding.

---

## 3. Domain Layer

### Step 3.1 ‚Äî Entities
Define immutable models with `freezed`:
- `DetectedDevice`
- `DeviceRiskLevel`
- `ScanSource`

‚úÖ **Test:** Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` ‚Äî no generation errors.

---

### Step 3.2 ‚Äî Use Cases
Implement:
- `GetNetworkDevicesUseCase`
- `GetBluetoothDevicesUseCase`
- `GetSubscriptionStatusUseCase`
- `PurchaseSubscriptionUseCase`
- `RestorePurchasesUseCase`

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Mock repositories with `mocktail` ‚Äî verify success/failure paths.

---

### Step 3.3 ‚Äî Failure Models
Create `Failure` union types using `freezed` (e.g., `NetworkFailure`, `BluetoothFailure`).

‚úÖ **Test:** Ensure all `when()` and `map()` cases compile and are handled.

---

## 4. Data Layer

### Step 4.1 ‚Äî Pigeon Channel Setup
- Define `pigeons/scanner_api.dart` with explicit scan lifecycle calls:
  - `startWifiScan()`, `stopWifiScan()`
  - `startBluetoothScan()`, `stopBluetoothScan()`
- Include a Flutter-to-native streaming channel (e.g., `ScannerApiStream`) that emits `DetectedDeviceDto` objects incrementally as native scanners discover them.
- Document the expected JSON schema / field mapping so Dart repositories can translate incoming events into domain entities.
- Run generator:
  ```bash
  flutter pub run pigeon --input pigeons/scanner_api.dart
  ```
- Commit generated files.

‚úÖ **Test:** Build iOS project ‚Äî ensure compilation success and verify a stub Flutter listener receives streaming events from the generated API.

---

### Step 4.2 ‚Äî Native iOS Implementation
In `ios/Runner/`:
- Create:
  - `ScannerPlugin.swift`
  - `MdnsScanner.swift`
  - `BluetoothScanner.swift`
- `ScannerPlugin.swift` implements the Pigeon `HostApi` facade, wiring Flutter commands to native scanners and exposing the shared event stream back to Dart.
- `MdnsScanner.swift` and `BluetoothScanner.swift` encapsulate platform APIs (Bonjour/CoreBluetooth). Each class checks its respective authorization status before scanning; on missing permission, immediately surface a descriptive error (see Step‚ÄØ4.2.1).
- Configure permissions in `Info.plist`:
  ```
  NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription
  NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription
  ```
- Run scanning on background threads; dispatch discovered devices to the event stream on the main thread.

‚úÖ **Test:** Run on physical iPhone ‚Üí invoking `startWifiScan()` streams mocked devices in near real time; stopping the scan halts further events.

---

### Step 4.2.1 ‚Äî Error Propagation Bridge
- Wrap native failures (e.g., permission denied, hardware unavailable) in `FlutterError` instances with stable error codes (`PERMISSION_DENIED`, `SCAN_FAILED`, etc.).
- Ensure the generated Dart API surfaces these errors so the repository layer can map codes to the appropriate `Failure` union variants.

‚úÖ **Test:** Simulate a denied permission ‚Üí Dart repository receives `FlutterError` and maps it to the expected `Failure`.

---


### Step 4.3 ‚Äî Permissions
- Enforce the clarified iOS permission flow:
  - Onboarding requests only Local Network access, priming the user with the App Store‚Äìapproved copy.
  - Bluetooth permissions (`NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`, `Permission.bluetoothScan`, etc.) are requested lazily the first time a Bluetooth scan is initiated.
  - Location permission is excluded in V1.
- Build UI affordances for denied and permanently denied states, including deep links to open iOS Settings when needed.

‚úÖ **Test:** Denying Local Network or Bluetooth shows the appropriate limitation copy; permanently denied permissions surface a ‚ÄúOpen Settings‚Äù CTA that launches `openAppSettings()`.

---

### Step 4.4.1 ‚Äî RevenueCat Prerequisites & Paywall Strategy
- Enable the **In-App Purchase** capability for the Runner target in Xcode (Signing & Capabilities) before building or testing monetization flows.
- Adopt RevenueCat‚Äôs `purchases_ui_flutter` package for the paywall experience (e.g., `PaywallView`/`presentPaywallIfNeeded`) so product fetching, display, and purchase handling are delegated to RevenueCat.
- Update Step‚ÄØ2.6 to invoke the pre-built paywall component and only retain bespoke UI elements that wrap or frame the RevenueCat view (e.g., onboarding context, blur, copy).
- Document any design requirements that would force a fully custom paywall so the team can reassess before diverging from the pre-built tooling.

‚úÖ **Test:** Integrate RevenueCat‚Äôs sample offerings and confirm `PaywallView` renders in the paywall screen with products visible; verify dismissal routes users back to the appropriate screen.

---

### Step 4.4.2 ‚Äî RevenueCat Integration
- Add `purchases_flutter` and wrap it in a `RevenueCatDataSource` responsible for offerings, purchases, restores, and `CustomerInfo` updates.
- Configure RevenueCat once during app bootstrap via `Purchases.configure(PurchasesConfiguration(APPLE_API_KEY))` after enabling debug logging for development builds.
- Implement `SubscriptionRepository` with the new data source so domain use cases remain UI-agnostic. Ensure Riverpod (or equivalent) providers consume this repository for subscription status and product listings.
- Surface `Purchases.customerInfoStream` through the repository so the subscription provider reacts to upgrades, restores, or expirations in real time.
- Run an auto-restore flow at startup that consumes the latest `CustomerInfo` and updates the central premium state provider before the UI renders.

‚úÖ **Test:** Mock the data source to confirm repository methods surface the correct domain results, and verify auto-restore plus the customer-info stream update the premium provider on startup. Sandbox purchase/restore should toggle premium UI paths without manual refresh.

---

### Step 4.5 ‚Äî Logging & Diagnostics
- **CRITICAL PRIVACY REQUIREMENT:** Never log PII (e.g., IP addresses, MAC addresses, device names). Route all logging through a sanitised utility that strips or redacts sensitive fields before emitting messages.
- Add `logger` package for development-only diagnostics.
- (Optional) Add Crashlytics/Sentry (with ATT prompt if needed) once the logging wrapper guarantees no PII leakage.
- Enable verbose RevenueCat logging in development via `Purchases.setLogLevel(LogLevel.debug)` before configuring the SDK to simplify sandbox diagnostics.

‚úÖ **Test:**
- Inspect all logging statements (including third-party wrappers) to confirm no PII is ever passed.
- Run a release build while tailing the device console to ensure only non-sensitive logs‚Äîand none at all in production‚Äîare emitted.

---

## 5. IR Light Detection

### Step 5.1 ‚Äî Implement IR Camera
- Use `camera` package.
- Apply grayscale filter using `ColorFiltered`.
- Show permission prompt if denied.

‚úÖ **Test:** Open IR tab ‚Äî grayscale camera view active; permission denial handled cleanly.

---

## 6. Monetization Logic

### Step 6.1 ‚Äî RevenueCat Entitlement Handling
- Define single ‚Äúpremium‚Äù entitlement.
- Provide stream-based `SubscriptionProvider` using Riverpod.

‚úÖ **Test:** Change entitlement ‚Üí UI updates in real time (premium features unlock).

---

## 7. App Lifecycle & Resource Management

### Step 7.1 ‚Äî Scan Management
- Automatically cancel scans after **60 seconds**.
- Stop active scans when app backgrounded.

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Scan auto-stops at 60s.  
Backgrounding stops scan.

---

## 8. Security & Privacy

### Step 8.1 ‚Äî Data Clearing
- Implement `clearAllData()` in settings.
- Wipe shared preferences.

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Clear data ‚Üí onboarding shown again on next app launch.

---

### Step 8.2 ‚Äî Privacy Manifest
- Add `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`.
- Ensure no PII (MAC/IP) logged.

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Validate build via App Store Connect ‚Äî no privacy warnings.

---

## 9. Testing Strategy

### Step 9.1 ‚Äî Unit Tests
- Achieve 100% coverage on domain use cases.
- Use `mocktail` for dependencies.

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Run `flutter test --coverage` ‚Üí 100% domain coverage.

---

### Step 9.2 ‚Äî Widget & Golden Tests
- Test AsyncValue states (loading/data/error).
- Add Golden tests for all core widgets.

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Run test suite in CI ‚Äî no regressions in golden images.

---

### Step 9.3 ‚Äî Integration Tests
- Mock Pigeon APIs.
- Simulate scan ‚Üí paywall ‚Üí purchase ‚Üí dashboard flow.

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Integration tests complete successfully with no failures.

---

## 10. CI/CD Setup

### Step 10.1 ‚Äî Continuous Integration
- Add GitHub Actions (or Codemagic) workflow:
  - `flutter analyze`
  - `flutter test`
  - Optional: build & deploy to TestFlight.

‚úÖ **Test:**  
PR with failing lint/test ‚Üí blocked.  
Fixed ‚Üí passes CI.

---

## 11. Performance Validation

### Step 11.1 ‚Äî Verify Performance Targets
- **Cold Start:** < 2.5s  
- **Scan Duration:** ‚â§ 60s  
- **UI FPS:** ‚â• 60fps (frame build time < 16ms)

‚úÖ **Test:**  
Profile using Flutter DevTools ‚Äî all metrics within limits.

### Future Considerations
- Swap `context.go` for `context.push`/`pop` on drill-down routes so iOS users regain the native swipe-back gesture once the navigation audit is complete.
- Trigger the true Local Network permission dialog by wiring the production mDNS/CoreBluetooth scanners; the current mock flow only validates denial messaging.
